> A project to create fractals in C using the MLX42 library.

## üîû About the Project

This project aims to learn how to create graphical applications using the MLX42 library.

MLX42 is a open source, cross-platform graphics library for C that abstracts away the underlying windowing system. This allows programmers to focus on the graphics instead of system specifics.

A program implements the following fractals:

- Mandelbrot set (selected with 1) 
- Julia set (selected with 2)
- Burning Ship (selected with 3)

The program is written in C using the MLX42 library for 2D graphics rendering.

By completing this project, students will gain experience creating 2D graphics applications and working with an open source library. The fractal visualizations also provide an interesting mathematical component.

## ü§å Usage

Before running the program, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, depending on your operating system.

### macOS

```bash
brew update
brew install glfw
```

If you are a student of 42 M√°laga and encounter the error "command not found: brew" run the following command to install Homebrew:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://rawgit.com/kube/42homebrew/master/install.sh | zsh
```

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libx11-dev libglfw3-dev libglfw3 xorg-dev
```

Once the libraries are installed, you can build and run the program using the following commands:

```
make
./fractol 1/2/3
```
Replace 1/2/3 with the desired fractal selection:
   * 1:Mandelbrot set
   * 2: Julia set
   * 3: Burning Ship fractal
