> A project to create fractals in C using the MLX42 library.

## About the Project

This project aims to learn how to create graphical applications using the MLX42 library.

MLX42 is a open source, cross-platform graphics library for C that abstracts away the underlying windowing system. This allows programmers to focus on the graphics instead of system specifics.

A program implements the following fractals:

- Mandelbrot set (selected with 1) 
- Julia set (selected with 2)
- Burning Ship (selected with 3)

The program is written in C using the MLX42 library for 2D graphics rendering.

By completing this project, students will gain experience creating 2D graphics applications and working with an open source library. The fractal visualizations also provide an interesting mathematical component.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- MLX42 library for graphics

## Getting Started 

To run the program, download the project files and enter the following in the terminal:

make

./fractol 1/2/3

Where 1 selects the Mandelbrot set, 2 selects the Julia set, and 3 selects the Burning Ship fractal.
